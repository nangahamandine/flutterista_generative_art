# Nangah Amandine's Generative HeARTs

## Welcome to my Generative Art, created with Dart (Flutter).

This generative art contains a Flutter application that renders a captivating array of heart shapes in a dynamic, layered oval pattern, reminiscent of traditional African art. 
Embracing the themes of love and mystery, the design combines a deep contrast background with varying shades of orange, creating a stunning visual depth and a pulsating illusion of movement. 
Each heart contributes to the overall aesthetic, symbolizing affection and the rich visual storytelling found in African cultures.

The intentional color choices and the play of shadows serve to not only draw the eye but also to create a rhythmic pattern that pulsates with life and intensity. 
This piece is more than just an application; it's an homage to the rich tapestry of African artistry and a testament to the enduring symbol of love.
